'''Classes for variable elimination Routines 

   Note: 
      The following three classes have a name field. The name field is not
      necessarily unique, and exists primarily for output purposes. 

   A) class Variable

      This class allows one to define Bayes Net variables.

      On initialization the variable object can be given a name and a
      domain of values. This list of domain values can be added to or
      deleted from in support of an incremental specification of the
      variable domain.

      The variable also has a set and get value method. These set a
      value for the variable that can be used by the factor class. 

    B) class Factor

      This class allows one to define a factor specified by a table
      of values. 

      On initialization the variables the factor is over is
      specified. This must be a list of variables. This list of
      variables cannot be changed once the constraint object is
      created.

      Once created the factor can be incrementally initialized with a
      list of values. To interact with the factor object one first
      sets the value of each variable in its scope (using the
      variable's set_value method), then one can set or get the value
      of the factor (a number) on those fixed values of the variables
      in its scope.

      Initially, one creates a factor object for every conditional
      probability table in the bayes-net. Then one initializes the
      factor by iteratively setting the values of all of the factor's
      variables and then adding the factor's numeric value using the
      add_value method. 

    C) class BayesianNetwork
       This class allows one to put factors and variables together to form a Bayes net.
       It serves as a convient place to store all of the factors and variables associated
       with a Bayes Net in one place. It also has some utility routines to, e.g,., find
       all of the factors a variable is involved in. 


  You may call min_fill_ordering to calculate the variable elimination when 
  performing variable elimination

class Factor: 

    '''Class for defining factors. A factor is a function that is over
    an ORDERED sequence of variables called its scope. It maps every
    assignment of values to these variables to a number. In a Bayes
    Net every CPT is represented as a factor. Pr(A|B,C) for example
    will be represented by a factor over the variables (A,B,C). If we
    assign A = a, B = b, and C = c, then the factor will map this
    assignment, A=a, B=b, C=c, to a number that is equal to Pr(A=a|
    B=b, C=c). During variable elimination new factors will be
    generated. However, the factors computed during variable
    elimination do not necessarily correspond to conditional
    probabilities. Nevertheless, they still map assignments of values
    to the variables in their scope to numbers.

    Note that if the factor's scope is empty it is a constaint factor
    that stores only one value. add_values would be passed something
    like [[0.25]] to set the factor's single value. The get_value
    functions will still work.  E.g., get_value([]) will return the
    factor's single value. Constant factors may be created when a
    factor operation is performed'''
